# :open_file_folder: Insurance-Premium-End-to-End-Project
- This repository contains code to predict the price of insurance based on the given parameters.
 
# Objective ðŸŽ¯
The goal of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of machine-learning methodologies for predicting insurance expensesÂ prediction.

## Problem statement ðŸ“œ
- The goal of this project is to provide an estimate of how much health coverage a person will need based on their specific situation. 
- After receiving this information, customers can work with any insurance carrier and its plans while keeping in mind the estimated cost from our study. 
- This could help someone concentrate on the positive aspects of having insurance instead of worrying about the expenses associated with it.

## Technology ï¿½
Machine Learning 

## Project Difficulty level ðŸ¥‡
Advanced

## Tools Used:
### 1. Python 
### 2. Numpy 
### 3. Pandas
### 4. Plotly
### 5. Matplotlib
### 6. Seaborn 
### 7. Machine Learning Algorithms
### 8. MS-Excel

## platform
### Jupyter Notebook, VS Code, Github, Heroku 

## Operations Performes:
### 1. Data Collection: 
#### -> Data is taken from site given by the organization.
### 2. Data Cleaning:
#### -> Every dataset consists of some missing values and outliers. The categorical missing values are filled with most frequent value i.e. mode while the numeric values are filled with mean. Also the outliers are treated with the mean value correspoiding to their item type. Also removed the duplicate data.
### 3. Data Visualization: 
#### -> Visualizations are performed using libraries like matplotlib, seaborn and plotly by plotting histogram, countplots, scatter plot, etc.
### 4. Data Analysis: 
#### -> Performing data analysis to get valuable insights from the plots.
### 5. Deployment:
#### ->  web app is deployed on GitHub.

## Conclusion ðŸ’¡
- This system shows us that the different techniques that are used in order to estimate the how much amount of premium required on the basis of individual health situation. 
- After analyzing it shows how a smoker and non-smokers affecting the amount of estimate. 
- Also, significant difference between male and female expenses. 
- Accuracy, which plays a key role in prediction-based system.  
- From the results we could see that Gradient Boosting turned out to be best working model for this problem in terms of the accuracy. 
- Our predictions help user to know how much amount premium they need on the basis of their current health situation.
